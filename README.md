# Forecasting_sales_kaggle

This project is about Forecasting. I used data from kaggle in order to predict sale products based on many features. 
Features had to be engineered ! In order to achieve a good accuracy we need to add as many features as we can. Also, you have to dive in the word 
of data and understand it in order to make modelling possible.
